          couldn’t read it if we wanted to.

          {TOOL_NAME} saves three things in your browser’s local storage: the
          text you’re working on, so it survives a refresh, your light or
          dark theme choice, and the random analytics identifier described
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from the analytics identifier, that data lives only on your
          device. It’s not sent to a server, and
          it isn’t shared between your devices or browsers.

      <StaticSection heading="No accounts, no third-party trackers">
        <p>
          There’s nothing to sign up for, and no third-party trackers,
          advertising pixels, or cookies. We count usage on our own
          self-hosted analytics: pages visited, tools used, your browser
          and operating system type, and your approximate location
          (country and city, estimated from your IP address — the address
          itself is never stored).
        </p>
        <p>
          To tell returning visitors apart, a random identifier is kept in
          your browser’s local storage. It says nothing about who you are,
          and clearing this site’s data removes it. If your browser sends
          Do Not Track, we don’t count you at all.
        </p>
      </StaticSection>

      <StaticSection heading="Clearing your data">
        <p>
          Use “Clear text” to empty the counter, or clear this site’s data in
          your browser settings to remove everything at once. Gone means gone
          — there’s no copy anywhere else.
